## Description of the Task

The primary objective of this internship project is to design, implement, and demonstrate a generative text model capable of producing coherent, contextually relevant paragraphs on arbitrary topics provided by a user. Over the course of four weeks, I will explore and integrate two complementary approaches to natural language generation: a transformer-based model (GPT‑2) and a recurrent neural network (LSTM). By the end of the internship, the project deliverable will consist of a fully documented Jupyter Notebook showcasing the end‑to‑end workflow, from data preparation and model configuration to sampling and evaluation, accompanied by practical usage examples derived from user prompts.

Natural language generation (NLG) represents one of the most compelling frontiers in artificial intelligence, with applications spanning creative writing assistance, educational content generation, dialogue systems, and automated reporting. GPT‑2, developed by OpenAI, has set a high standard for fluency and coherence by leveraging self‑attention mechanisms and large‑scale unsupervised pretraining. Concurrently, traditional LSTM architectures, although less fashionable, remain foundational to sequential modeling and provide educational value in illustrating how recurrent units learn temporal dependencies in language data. This project balances both paradigms to provide a didactic comparison as well as a practical toolkit for users.

### Week 1: Environment Setup and Data Exploration

* **Toolchain installation**: Install and configure Python libraries including Hugging Face’s Transformers, TensorFlow/Keras, and essential utilities such as NumPy and Pandas.
* **Baseline tests**: Run minimal examples of text generation on both GPT‑2 and an untrained LSTM to verify the environment.
* **Dataset assembly**: Curate a small, domain‑agnostic text corpus for optional fine‑tuning of the LSTM (e.g., excerpts from Wikipedia or public domain novels). Investigate tokenization schemes using Keras Tokenizer and Hugging Face Tokenizers.

### Week 2: Transformer‑Based Generation (GPT‑2)

* **Pipeline integration**: Utilize the `pipeline('text-generation')` interface from Hugging Face to generate text from the pre‑trained GPT‑2 model.
* **Parameter tuning**: Experiment with core decoding parameters—`max_length`, `temperature`, `top_k`, and `top_p`—to observe their impact on creativity versus coherence.
* **Evaluation metrics**: Implement basic automated measures such as perplexity (where applicable) and simple human‑readable heuristics (e.g., absence of repetition).
* **Quality demonstration**: Collect representative examples of generated output on diverse prompts (e.g., technology trends, historical summaries, fictional storytelling).

### Week 3: LSTM‑Based Generation

* **Model architecture design**: Construct an Embedding → LSTM → Dense architecture in Keras, selecting appropriate embedding size, LSTM units, and dropout for regularization.
* **Training regimen**: Tokenize the assembled corpus into n‑gram sequences, pad them, and train the LSTM for a sufficient number of epochs to achieve coherent short‑form text.
* **Sampling strategy**: Implement a sampling loop that predicts one word at a time, appending it to the seed text. Explore techniques such as sampling with temperature.
* **Comparative analysis**: Generate paragraphs on identical prompts using both GPT‑2 and the LSTM, highlighting strengths (GPT‑2’s fluency) and limitations (LSTM’s shorter context window).

### Week 4: Integration, Documentation, and Final Demonstration

* **Unified interface**: Develop a wrapper function `generate_on_topic(topic, model_type)` that routes user prompts to the selected model and returns a polished paragraph.
* **Notebook narrative**: Compose clear markdown explanations adjacent to code cells, describing the purpose and expected outcomes of each step. Ensure reproducibility by fixing random seeds where appropriate.
* **Error handling**: Add input validation, exception catching, and informative error messages to the generation functions.
* **Showcase**: Create a final section with diverse user‑driven sample prompts—ranging from technical summaries to creative vignettes—demonstrating the model’s versatility.

This project will not only serve as a functional demonstration of state‑of‑the‑art generative techniques but will also provide educational insights into model internals, training workflows, and evaluation considerations. By delivering a robust, user‑friendly Jupyter Notebook, this internship ensures that subsequent developers or researchers can replicate, extend, and apply these generative models to a broad spectrum of AI‑driven text composition tasks. Feel free to review and suggest enhancements; I look forward to refining the pipeline for even richer and more controllable text generation experiences.
